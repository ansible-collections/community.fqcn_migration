          Red Hat has tested this collection against Ansible versions 2.9.10 or later.

          Red Hat might test the plug-ins and modules that are within a collection with specific Ansible versions only. A collection can contain metadata that identifies these Ansible versions.

          For demonstration purposes, you can run the collection directly from this folder. However, the proper setup is to download and install the collection from the Red Hat Automation Hub.

          Before you install the collection, you must ensure that your system complies with the following prerequisites:
            - You have installed the ansible-core package version 2.12 or later on a control node in your system by installing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.x.
            - You have updated the ansible.cfg file to use the Red Hat Automation Hub as your *primary source* of Ansible collections.
          You can install the collection on your Ansible control node by using the following command:
              $ ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.jws

          The redhat.jws collection v{{ galaxy_version | default('0.0.0-dev') }} is released as a [Technology Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview) feature as the [Red Hat Ansible certified content collection for JBoss Web Server](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/jws). If you have any issues or questions related to this collection, please contact <Ansible-middleware-core@redhat.com> or open an issue at https://github.com/ansible-middleware/jws/issues.

          For more information about using this collection, see [Installing JBoss Web Server by using the Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collection](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_web_server/5.7/html-single/installing_jboss_web_server_by_using_the_red_hat_ansible_certified_content_collection/index).
